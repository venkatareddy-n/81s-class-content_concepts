-------------------

stateful vs stateless

stateful --> which has state, i.e data
stateless --> which don't have state.

DB --> stateful, it keeps track of the data
backend/frontend --> stateless

DB
-------
backup --> hourly, daily, weekly backups
restore test
data replication --> 
DB-1 is connected to application
DB-2 is not connected to application, but replicate data from DB-1

HYD --> DB-1, MUM --> DB-2
storage increment
load balancing
upgrades

RDS --> load balancing, auto storage increment, backups/snapshots, etc..

ExpenseApp1

8.0.35 --> 8.0.36
8.0 --> 8.1 --> 9

rds opensource module

mysql-dev.daws81s.online --> expense.czn6yzxlcsiv.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

snapshot/backup --> destroy --> final snapshot(VPC)

Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
--------------------------------

DM --> Client

work --> UI work --> UI team lead --> team members
Backend work --> Backend team lead --> team members
who is available to work, team lead will assign

team --> target group
team lead --> load balancer
listener and rules --> He is listening for UI work, Backend team lead is listening for backend work
who is available --> health check
members --> servers

if backend server is running we can hit that on 8080, if not running we can't hit


8080, 80 --> servers are listening on these port

http://3.94.106.200/ --> 2XX

LB Listener --> 80 --> nginx --> 80 --> 2 instances --> lb will check which instance is healthy --> randomly 1 server

Auto scaling
------------------
2 members --> 16 hr work
30 hr work --> our HR should recruit new members --> add them to our team

JD --> Launch template(Options to create servers) --> place them inside target group

CPU utilisation --> 75%
