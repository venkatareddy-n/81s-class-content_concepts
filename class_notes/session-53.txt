HPA
Helm charts

Scaling
----------
1. Horizontal
2. Vertical

Vertical --> Only one building, downtime is there
Horizontal --> multiple buildings, no downtime

Server --> traffic increase

Same server --> Stop the server, increase CPU and RAM then restart
Diff servers --> number of servers increases based on traffic

Percentage --> Max value (100)

Containers can consume all server resources if something goes wrong. we have to mention resource requests and limits

100m --> CPU
60m --> 60%

You should have metrics server installed
You should mention resources section inside pod
Once above things are done, we can attach HPA to deployment

curl -sS https://webinstall.dev/k9s | bash
