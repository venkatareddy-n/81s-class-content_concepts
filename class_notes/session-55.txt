EKS uses IAM for authentication

EKS --> Platform as a service

Authentication
--------------
I need to create user in IAM

Suresh joined our team
-----------------------
Expense team will send an email to EKS admin

give him read access to expense namespace

they create IAM user, create a role for suresh to describe eks cluster..
they create role and rolebinding
provide access to suresh

EKS and IAM are two different systems

there is something called aws-auth config map inside kube-system

IAM checks whether user have expense EKS cluster access or not

taints and tolerations
affinity and anti affinity

kube-scheduler --> master node component

kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml

nodeSelector:
	az: us-east-1b
	
taint --> paint
banks and RBI may accept painted notes --> they can tolerate

you can taint the node. kube-scheduler can't schedule any pod in that node...
GPU based servers are required for expense project...

taint these GPU nodes
expense project users should give toleration in their manifest files

1. EKS is integrated with IAM for authentication
2. aws-auth configmap

1. make sure IAM user exist and he have cluster describe access
2. create role and rolebinding
3. edit aws-auth configmap
