loops
------------
for(int i=0;i<=100;i++{
	print i;
}

Acer Swift go 14
i5, 16GB --> 62k

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
	echo $i
done

logs are very important for any coding

redirectors
--------------
ls -l > output.txt --> by default it redirects only success output
1 --> success
2 --> error

ls -l 2> output.txt --> redirect only error output

ls -l &> output.txt

16-redirectors.sh --> 16-redirectors

/var/log/shell-script/16-redirectors-<timestamp>.log

write logs on termial and logfile both...
imp msgs on termial 

tee --> writes logs to multile destinations
