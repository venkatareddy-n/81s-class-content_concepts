we will create cluster
we will run app
we will upgrade cluster

10.0.0.0/16

pod-1 is in node-1
pod-2 is in node-2

pod-2 is receiving traffic from pod-1

node-2 should allow traffic from node-1

blue group of nodes --> current running

green group of nodes --> 

Cluster Upgrade
-------------------------
it is better to announce downtime, you should not do any release or deployments or changes to any resources

change the sg, so that only admin team bastion have access to cluster...

1. create another node group green with same capacity...
2. cordon green nodes, not to accept any pods
3. upgrade control plane to 1.31
4. upgrade green also to 1.31
5. we will cordon blue nodes, uncordon green nodes
6. drain all blue nodes
7. delete blue node group

now runing node group is green,
