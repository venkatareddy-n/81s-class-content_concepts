Git
---------
create repo
git clone
git add --> staging area
git commit -m  "" --> commit to local repo
git push --> push to central repo
Git is a distributed version control system...

Linus Torvalds --> 2005

git init --> convert a folde into git repo. .git folder will be created
git remote add origin <url>
git branch -M main

Branching
----------------
main --> points to production

create another copy of the file, do the changes, carefully review the changes. if okay then edit into the main file

create another branch from main branch
do the changes
test the changes
scan the changes

if everything is fine bring those changes into main branch

SHA code --> 40char code

e87bbd7883f2ddafc6243ae694acbfd18608ba17 --> our code

1. if the commit id is changed, we can say code is changed
2. if the code is changed, commit id also changed

no body is allowed to do changes in main branch...
pull request --> some one have to review before you merge changes into main branch.

create another branch from main branch, do changes, create PR. get the approval then merge changes


62918daf857b1c13127fb2d00e93b80bf77b13a7 --> merge commit

-> Merge commit will have 2 parent commits.
-> Merging preserves history, at any point you can track all the history of changes.
-> Merge commit is an extra commit created by Git

-> Rebase will not create extra commits.
-> There is no history preserved in rebase since only one parent
-> commit id will be changed in rebase

if a branch is developed by multiple persons --> prefer merge

if a branch is developed by single person --> go for rebease, make sure how rebease works

How you resolve merge conflicts?
Conflict comes when git finds diff code in the same line. Then git will give conflict. now developers should discuss and resolve conflicts. Git shows conflicts using less than and greater than symbols. We have to discuss and decide what code we can keep then remove the special char and proceed to commit.
