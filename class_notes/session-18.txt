data types

functions == filters

python --> ansible is not giving opportunity to write custom functions, if we want we have to write python code and get that functionality

filter --> manipulations

ansible.builtin.command
ansible.builtin.shell

command vs shell
---------------------
command --> simple commands, it will not get the shell environment
shell --> complex like pipes, redirections, etc. it gets the shell environment

command is secure than shell, prefer use command if works

Expense Project
-----------------------
3 servers, 3 records
mysql.daws81.online --> private ip
backend.daws81.online --> private ip
frontend.daws81.online --> private ip
daws81.online --> public ip

ansible is not only CM tool, it can connect to any system if module is available

ansible --> AWS

aws configure
