Volumes in kubernetes
=====================
external HD --> Offline, near to our computer, more speed
google drive --> Online, somewhere in network, less speed

EBS and EFS

Static Provisioning
Dynamic Provisioning

Static Provisioning
--------------------
EBS

1. We need to create volumes
2. We need to install the drivers.
3. EKS nodes should have permissions to access EBS volumes.

node is in us-east-1b. can I create disk in us-east-1d?

vol-0e534628d19fc28f4
install drivers
-----------------
kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/?ref=release-1.36"

Persistant Volumes and Persistant volume claim
----------------------------------------------
k8 created a wrapper objects to manage underlying volumes. because k8 engineer will not have full idea on volumes.

PV --> It represents the physical storage like EBS/EFS.

pods should claim PV to access that....

1. is that namespace level or not?
2. if not namespace level that is cluster level. admin should create the resource

expense project devops engineer got a requirement to have a volume
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. you should an email to storage team to create disk. get the approval from manager. they create disk.
2. you send email to k8 admin to create PV and provide them disk details.

no it's your turn. pvc and claim in the pod


dynamic provisioning
-------------------------------
1. install drivers
2. give permissions ec2 nodes

storageClass
-----------------
admin creates one storage class for EBS for expense project. 

annotation --> curl nginx

nginx service --> nginx pod
