kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

ENV in image defition vs env in manifest
----------------------------------------
env in Dockerfile should rebuild if you change
env in manifest no need to rebuild, just restart is enough

resource utilisation
-----------------------
if something goes wrong in loop, it will occupy entire host resources. We need to allocate resources to the container.
1 cpu = 1000m cpu
softlimit --> 100m cpu, 68Mi 
hardlimit --> 120m cpu, 128Mi

without touching the actual code, we need to change the value --> variables

How can you access your pod in internet or outside?

pod IP are ephemeral
by exposing to services

DNS to pod and load balancer as well

1. cluster IP --> default. only for internal pod to pod communication...
2. node port
---------------
open a port on node/host
3. load balancer

services select pods using labels
selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: proxy

labels
---------
is single lable enough?
