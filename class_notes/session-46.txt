Docker Networking:

1. host
2. bridge --> default
3. overlay --> Between multiple docker hosts

host:
1. contianers using host n/w will not get IP address.
2. it means containers are sharing host IP address
3. containers open host port

mysql --> 3306 --> host port
backend --> 8080 --> host port
frontend --> 80 --> host port
