master
-------
api server --> intercepts every request to k8, checks authorization

scheduler --> schedules the pods on to worker nodes, it checks taints, tolerations, node selectors, affinity, anti affinity, hardware requirements, free CPU and memory

controller
 replica controller --> make sure always desired number of pods are running
 node controller --> monitoring the nodes continously
 job controller --> checks Jobs
 EndpointSlice controller --> establish connection between services and pods
 SA controller --> creates default sa for namespaces
 
etcd --> DB for our K8 configuration

node
--------

kubelet --> agent running inside worker node, to communicate with master
kube-proxy --> setup networking rules and policies to nodes and pods
container runtime --> container-d, crio.
