1. 3 ec2
2. 3 r53 records
	backend.daws81s.online --> t3.micro
	mysql.daws81s.online --> t3.small
	daws81s.online --> t3.micro
	
expression ? "true" : "false"

r53
-----
we should get the output of ec2 instanced created
aws_instance.terraform

backend.daws81s.online
var.instance_names = backend
domain_name = daws81s.online
"${var.instance_names[count.index]}.${var.domain_name}"

locals
---------------------
locals are like variables but it have some extra capabilities. You can store expressions and intermediate values in locals

variables can be overriden
but we can't override locals

1. variables and locals both can store values, but locals have some extra capabilities
2. locals can store expressions, terraform can run them and get the value
3. locals can use variables inside. variables can't refer locals
4. can override variables, can't override locals

state, remote state and locking
---------------------
mysql --> mysqllll

it is a simple name update, but ansible created another instance

assignment
---------------
I will check your notes and confirm whether you completed or not

declared infra, actual infra

terraform == declarative way of creating infra

tf files == infra I declared
aws infra == actual infra created

declared infra == actual infra

terraform.tfstate == terraform keeps track of what it created

aws_security_group.allow_ssh_terraform: Refreshing state... [id=sg-0994f93b69e9e3736]

before I delete
----------------
declared infra == actual infra --> true

After I delete
----------------
declared infra == actual infra --> false

terraform.tfstate --> instance created
real infra --> no, actually destroyed
config files --> create the infra


terraform.tfstate will be refereshed against real infra

remote state
----------------
I am creating infra from my laptop --> it will create infra
another person also tries to crate --> it will also create infra again

duplicates or errors

.lock --> programs will check if any .lock file is there, it will not allow others to edit 

remote storage --> s3 bucket
locking --> dynamo DB --> LockID
