Taints and Tolerations
Affinity and anti affinity

kube-scheduler --> responsible to schedule pods on to worker nodes

nodeSelector:
	label-key: value

taints and tolerations --> to repel the pods. We can mark the node as tainted so that scheduler will not schedule any pods on to it...

if you apply tolerate scheduler can schedule the pods on to tainted nodes, but not gaurenteed.

1. project specific worker nodes
2. special hardware. gpu based servers

pod affinity
------------
2 replicas are running
we will inform backend pod to run where cache is running --> pod-affinity

Ingress Controller
------------------
If we want give internet access to our app running in K8 we have to provison ingress controller. We are using ALB as our ingress controller. We installed aws load balancer controller drivers through helm charts and given appropriate permissions.

We create ingress resource/object for the apps that requires external access

HDFC --> k8 cluster

netbanking.hdfc.com --> netbanking
corporatebanking.hdfc.com --> C banking

Classic LB --> By default it creates classic load balancer
	it is not intelligent
	it can't route traffic to different target groups
	it is not recommend by AWS
	
ALB
	it is intelligent
	it routes traffic to multiple tg based on host or context rules
	it works on layer-7

m.facebook --> mobile fb target group
facebook.com
