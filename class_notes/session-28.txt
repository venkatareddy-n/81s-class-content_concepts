advantages
---------------
code reuse
updates are easy and centralised
best practices can be enforced
you can restrict user using few options as per project standards


VPC --> Virtual private cloud
-----------------------
business is restaurant orders

physical space
buy servers
power connection
network connection
security gaurd
cooling
OS resources, network resources
maintance

Cloud resource with cloud account

It is a isolated datacenter in cloud. resources created inside vpc is completely private...

frontend server --> public must access this
backend server --> secure, public should not access this. dont create public ip and no internet
mysql server --> all users and orders data, cards, etc...dont create public ip and no internet

You have to seperate servers logically inside VPC...

subnetting

village name, pincode --> VPC name, CIDR
streets name, number --> subnets name, CIDR
roads --> routes
main road --> internet connection, internet gateway
main gate of house --> security group/firewall
house --> server

CIDR --> classless interdomain routing

192.178.3.4 --> 4 octates

255.255.255.255 --> Max IP

10.0.0.0/16 --> CIDR

total IP address bits are 32. possible IP address are 2^32

10.0.0.1
10.0.0.2
.
.
.
10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0
10.0.1.1
.
.
.
10.0.1.255

2^16 = 65,536

10.0.0.0/24 --> first 3 are blocked

10.0.0.255

10.0.1.0/24 --> 10.0.1.0 ... 10.0.1.255
10.0.2.0/24 --> 10.0.2.0, 10.0.2.1 .... 10.0.2.255

10.0.1.0/32

VPC creation
subnet creation
igw creation

public and private subnet
-------------------------
subnet which has internet connection is called as public subnet. private/app subnet will not have internet connection as routes. database subnet is also called as private subnet

10.0.0.0/16 --> internal roads

create vpc
create igw and associate with VPC
create public, private and database subnets
create public, private and database route table
create routes inside route table
associate route tables with appropriate subnets
created elastic IP
created NAT gateway
added NAT routes in private and database subnets

secure servers can't be reached directly...this is incoming/ingress traffic
traffic from the servers ... outgoing/egress traffic

database --> yum install mysql-server --> outgoing

what is NAT --> this is the mechanism private servers connects to internet for outgoing traffic like packages installation, security patches downloads

NAT --> when server stops and starts IP address will change.It should have same IP always

static IP/ elastic IP

High availability
-------------------
HYD --> Region
east hyderabad --> AZ
west hyderabad --> AZ

1 public subnet in us-east-1a, 1 public subnet in us-east-1b
1 private subnet in us-east-1a, 1 private subnet in us-east-1b
1 database subnet in us-east-1a, 1 database subnet in us-east-1b


EC2 Module
------------
it should accept count/instance_names
use instance_names inside tags
