Ansible Vault
-----------------
ansible-vault create credentials.yaml

Ansible Tags
-----------------
I have 100 tasks n my playbook, how to run 10 tasks... using ansible tags

Person --> Name, DOB, address

Ansible Dynamic Inventory
-----------------
inventory.ini --> static file

servers increase when traffic increase --> auto scaling

ansible should query cloud and get the IP address dynamically at that time...

1. authenticate
2. region
3. name
4. running
5. private ip

*.aws_ec2.yml --> file name should be like this

How can you connect to multiple servers?
---------------------------------------
ansible --> 1000 t3.xlarge

forks = 5 --> ansible connects to 5 servers at a time and complete the tasks --> task level
serial =3 --> runs playbook first 3 servers, again it will connect to next 3 servers --> play level

mysql -> mysqlll

updated mysql --> mysqlll

ansible is for configuration management
