Terraform
------------
IaaC advantages
variables
data types
conditions
loops --> count based loop, count.index --> used for lists
functions

locals --> to store expressions
outputs --> provide the output of resources, like IP, id, etc.
data sources --> query the information from provider like AMI ID, etc.
state and remote state --> terraform uses state concept to compare declared vs actual/real infra. We keep state remotely in colloboration envrionment.
locking --> make sure infra provisioning is not running parellely
tfvars --> to override default variables

for each is used to iterate map...

expense infra
-------------
frontend -> t3.micro
backend --> t3.micro
mysql --> t3.small
[] --> list
{} --> map

if frontend name should be daws81s.online otherwise backend/mysql.daws81s.online

dynamic
--------

provisioners
------------------
provisioners are used to take some actions locally or remotely..

local --> where terraform executed is local...my laptop
remote --> inside the servers you created..inside the servers of backend, frontend, mysql. etc.

1. local-exec
2. remote-exec

remote-exec --> execute commands inside remote server
