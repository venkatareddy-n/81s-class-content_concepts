cherry pick
restore

you can pick whatever cherries you want.

When you find something useful in another branches, you can pick those commits instead of completely merge or rebase with that branch

imagine 2 features branches, feature-1 and feature-2. feature-2 finds something useful in feature-1 instead of completely merging with it we can cherrypick the commits we want...

git checkout feature-1

git pull

git checkout feature-2

git log feature-1 --> you can see the commits, select what you want
git cherry-pick <commit-id> --> this may create conflicts, resolve and push

restore
-------------------
reset vs revert


git restore --staging <file-name> --> it will bring the changes from staging area to workspace

git restore --source <file-name> --> can completely restore the file to that particular commit-id. but it will not remove the commit-id

restore works on particular file, reset or revert works on entire workspace..


CICD
----------------------
Continous Integration --> jenkins

Project Infra
Deploy applications

It is the way of integrating the code from source and create artifact. in between source and creating artifact we need to install dependencies, run unit test cases, scans, etc. instead of this manually we can automate through continus integration process... We are using Jenkins for CI.

take one server
--------------
git clone <url>
npm install --> downloads dependencies
npm test --> unit test cases
sonar-scan
zip --> zip the application

store the application into some other artifact server

Jenkins is a plain webserver, if you install plugins then jenkins can connect with other tools.


sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
sudo yum upgrade --> takes too much time, we can skip
# Add required dependencies for the jenkins package
sudo yum install fontconfig java-17-openjdk
sudo yum install jenkins
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins

in jenkins everything is called as job.. when you trigger it is called as build

pre-production shoot post-production

pre-build build post-build

manually created infra vs IaaC
-------------------------------
1. you can't restore if something goes wrong
2. we can track we did the changes.
3. can't reuse
4. no review of changes
5. no version control

if you make it as pipeline and keep it in git


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}
